# hi
ok since I am abandoning this for now, here are some instructions for when I get bakc to it:


## homepage
basically, see my picture for the layout of the homepage and important things

if you click the homepage, you should be able to click a link to open the projects page or the blog page (just add a link)

clicking the refresh button should reload the list of projects or list of blog posts



## blog page
the blog posts will all be on medium

link the posts here, sort by date



## projects page

the projects page (url of /projects or something) should list the projects and have links to their respective pages. you should be able to sort by date or coolness.

if you click each project (url of /projects/projectname or something), you should see a page that has the following info:
- Name of project
- Description of project
- Date of last release
- Status
- Tags

these pages will be generated using the json files. use javascript to handle the routing
